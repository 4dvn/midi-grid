[![Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/mxI5Q21d1T0/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/mxI5Q21d1T0 "Demo video")

midi-grid is an open source MIDI controller, main part of which is 8x8 LED illuminated button grid.

Main features of the device:
- 8x8 RGB LED illuminated button matrix
- 17 additional MIDI control buttons, most of them paired with RGB LED indicator
- 1 internal menu button
- 2 rotary encoders, acting as MIDI controls
- Monochrome LCD display with adjustable backlight
- Physical MIDI input and output ports

Currently device is developed to work with [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/),
specifically with modified [Launchpad95](http://motscousus.com/stuff/2011-07_Novation_Launchpad_Ableton_Live_Scripts/)
MIDI remote script - [Launchpad95g](https://github.com/zukaitis/Launchpad95g). Additional functionality, like stand-alone modes,
or compatibility with other DAWs may be implemented later.

More thorough information, regarding design and implementation, is available in [wiki of this project](https://github.com/zukaitis/midi-grid/wiki).
