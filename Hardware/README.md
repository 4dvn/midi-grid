# Hardware
PCB project is made using [Kicad](http://kicad-pcb.org/), everything, including 3D representation should work right out of the box. Bill of materials with links to most of the components used is provided in file [BOM.ods](https://github.com/zukaitis/midi-grid/blob/master/Hardware/BOM.ods).

At this point, PCB design is not yet tested, so there might be some changes. Also, required values of resistors R25-R28, R33-R36 and R41-R44 will vary depending on the LEDs you use, so calculating appropriate resistor values yourself is advised here.
